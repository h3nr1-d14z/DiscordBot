# Music Player - Restoration Complete ðŸŽµ

## What Was Restored

I've successfully restored your Discord bot's music player functionality by recreating the TypeScript source files from the compiled JavaScript files found in the `dist` directory.

### Music Commands Restored:
1. `/play [query]` - Play a song from YouTube (URL or search)
2. `/skip` - Skip the current song
3. `/stop` - Stop playback and clear queue
4. `/pause` - Pause the current song
5. `/resume` - Resume playback
6. `/queue` - Display the music queue
7. `/nowplaying` - Show current song info
8. `/volume [0-100]` - Adjust playback volume
9. `/loop [off/track/queue]` - Set loop mode
10. `/shuffle` - Shuffle the queue

### Core Components:
- **Music Service** (`src/services/musicService.ts`): Main music player logic
- **YouTube Search** (`src/utils/youtubeSearchFixed.ts`): YouTube search functionality
- **Commands** (`src/commands/music/`): All music command implementations

### Dependencies Added:
```json
"@discordjs/voice": "^0.17.0",
"@distube/ytdl-core": "^4.15.16",
"sodium-native": "^4.3.1"
```

## Important Notes

1. **YouTube Search**: The bot supports:
   - Direct YouTube URLs
   - Search queries (uses yt-dlp if installed, fallback to simple search)

2. **Audio Quality**: Set to highest available audio quality

3. **Permissions**: Bot needs:
   - Connect permission in voice channels
   - Speak permission in voice channels

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` to install the music dependencies
2. Ensure ffmpeg is installed on your system (required for audio processing)
3. Optionally install `yt-dlp` for better YouTube search support

## Troubleshooting

If music playback doesn't work:
1. Check ffmpeg installation: `ffmpeg -version`
2. Verify bot has voice channel permissions
3. Check logs for any YouTube-related errors
4. Consider installing yt-dlp: `pip install yt-dlp`

Your music player has been fully restored and integrated with the rest of your bot! ðŸŽ‰
